Convert Windows-style line endings to Unix-style 

sh sed -i 's/\r$//' select1.sh

sed 's/.$//'               # assumes that all lines end with CR/LF

The -i option comes in handy to edit the original file itself. If you use the -i option the sed command replaces the text in the original file itself rather than displaying it on the terminal. Be careful in using the -i option. Once you changed the contents of the file, you cannot revert back to the original file.

CRLF
CR and LF are control characters or bytecode that can be used to mark a line break in a text file.

CR = Carriage Return (\r, 0x0D in hexadecimal, 13 in decimal) — moves the cursor to the beginning of the line without advancing to the next line.
LF = Line Feed (\n, 0x0A in hexadecimal, 10 in decimal) — moves the cursor down to the next line without returning to the beginning of the line.
A CR immediately followed by a LF (CRLF, \r\n, or 0x0D0A) moves the cursor down to the next line and then to the beginning of the line.
